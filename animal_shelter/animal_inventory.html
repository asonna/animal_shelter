      <p>I'm Rover... and I must admit, I am feeling pretty down... I had this really wonderful thing, but I just lost it, and I'm really hoping I can find it again soon. It was called a home. See, I'm a super-smart boy who is very loyal affectionate, and playful. I'm housebroken, crate trained,  I love playing with other big dogs (not the little ones though!), I enjoy a good game of fetch, am great at hunting cats, and am as devoted and protective as they come. See, that's the reason I lost that valuable thing called a home. Once I had a family of my own I decided that I loved them so much that they didn't need anyone else in their life. So I decided not to let strangers get too close, especially when we are out on walks- see I have this thing called leash reactivity which means that I get really defensive if people or other animals get too close when I am on lead. Sometimes I'd decide not to let that other little furry four legged companion get his fare share of love either... so that family decided that I needed a new home. Not because I did't love them, but because I loved them a little too much... who thought too much love could get ya in trouble huh? Anyway, I suppose it really is best. I need a home without smaller animals or children, where I can receive all the training and guidance I need to overcome my fears and learn to be better about sharing all this love. So here I am, hoping to find what I've lost.</p>

      <p>You like girls with beautiful curves, right? A little padding for the petting? I know when I see a Greyhound I'm like "someone get that dog a milk-bone," you know what I'm saying?!? I got all the filling in all the right places- both inside and out! Good looks and a great big personality to match! I get along great with other bigger dogs, but I am not a fan of cats or small critters... I'm a chill girl who doesn't like to be pestered, so I prefer furry friends who just want to hang out and cuddle; no running, romping, yappin' or funny business. And respectful children 12+, I don't mind them one bit as long as they understand how a Queen like me should be treated. I want to be treated with respect, I want everyone to know that I am the Queen of the castle. I may be a lazy lady, but I do still like to work on my fitness, so walks around the neighborhood or strolls through nature would be good for me. And you best believe that I'm not only takin' pride in myself but in my house too... so you know I keep my place clean. I also keep my place safe, real safe, my family too; call me Queen Protector. Once you seen all the rest, come meet the best and get some of this Big Girl love. </p>

      <p>Gimme one shot and I know I can hit that bull's-eye on your heart. My name ain't Cupid, but I reckon I have just as much love to throw around as that chubby baby. I been down a long hard road in this life, but I never let it break my spirit. Sure I can be cantankerous with other dogs at times, but when you get to be my age you just don't put up with as much guff as you used to. I prefer that children around me should be 10+ and respectful of their elders. In my book, you get what you give and I don't give cats any love, so I expect the same from them, which is fine by me. My crate training has been going really well and I am pretty excited about having my own little den of solace. I mosey at my own pace and don't have too much giddyup, so low and slow is how I like to roll. My knees ain't what they used to be, so I don't really have any marathons in me anymore. But I still like to get out and throw the old ball around. If you can see it in your heart to give this old soldier one more tour of duty, I will pledge to you my heart, my love, and my honor.</p>

      <p>Hi! I am sweet as a cookie... and that's my favorite too! I'm really hoping that you are the match I've been searching for. I have excellent house manners: I am housebroken, crate trained, I don't grab food off tables, rummage through trash bags or chew on anything that isn't mine (furniture, shoes, kids' toys, etc.). I am great with kids, quiet and I love being with my family, I do great in car rides and I am oh so smart. I may not be ready to live with cats or other female dogs, but I'm always ready to make new people friends. I would love a fenced back yard so I can roam and be off leash, as dog parks aren't really my thing. I really need someone who can continue my training to be less reactive on leash when I see other dogs. Lucky for you, I am food and praise motivated and I love to learn if you have the time and patience to learn with me. I'm a happy, sweet girl and I will follow and love you until the end of time! Come in and see how sweet I am!</p>
